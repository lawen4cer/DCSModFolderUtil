# DCSModFolderUtil
Just a GUI utility I made to automate DCS mod folder creation. 

Download the latest release under releases. 

Unzip the folder and run DCSModFolderUtil.exe

The first time that you run the application, you will have to manually point the program to your DCS root path and output path. These paths will save until they are changed. 

You can add multiple files to your mod as long as the output and mod name is the same. Just add the target file and click execute. Then go back in and select a different file and click execute again. This will maintain the directory structure.
